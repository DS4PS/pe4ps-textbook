NAME: Car Data
TYPE: Multiple Regression
SIZE: 810 observations, 12 variables
 
DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Data collected from Kelly Blue Book for several hundred 2005 used GM cars allows students to develop 
a multivariate regression model to determine their car value based on a variety of characteristics 
such as mileage, make, model, engine size, interior style, and cruise control. Students learn to 
look at residual plots and check for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and multicollinearity.

SOURCES:

For this data set, a representative sample of over eight hundred, 2005 GM cars were selected, 
then an algorithm was developed following the 2005 Central Edition of the Kelly Blue Book to 
estimate retail price. </p>

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
Price: suggested retail price of the used 2005 GM car in excellent condition. The condition of a 
        car can greatly affect price. All cars in this data set were less than one year old when 
        priced and considered to be in excellent condition. 
Mileage: number of miles the car has been driven
Make: manufacturer of the car such as Saturn, Pontiac, and Chevrolet
Model: specific models for each car manufacturer such as Ion, Vibe, Cavalier
Trim (of car): specific type of car model such as SE Sedan 4D, Quad Coupe 2D
Type: body type such as sedan, coupe, etc.
Cylinder: number of cylinders in the engine	
Liter: a more specific measure of engine size

Cruise: indicator variable representing whether the car has cruise control (1 = cruise)
Sound: indicator variable representing whether the car has upgraded speakers (1 = upgraded)
Leather: indicator variable representing whether the car has leather seats (1 = leather)
